#### What is BMI?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person.

#### Calculating the BMI
BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:

> BMI = kg/m^2

where *kg* represents the person's weight and *m^2* the person's squared height.

In this calculator we get input Height as **centimeters(cm)** and Weight as **Kilogram(kg)** units

#### About this BMI Calculator

This *BMI Calculator* is for adults 20 years and older. Further information on calculating BMI for children and teenagers is available from the CDC [2].
